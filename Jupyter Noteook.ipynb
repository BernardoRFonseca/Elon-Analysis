    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is divided in two parts, both can be run using Databricks, but for academics purposes I have split it into two parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "PART I - Databricks: this first part will show how to create and query a table or DataFrame that was uploaded to DBFS by Databricks. [DBFS](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/dbfs-databricks-file-system.html) is a Databricks File System that allows you to store data for querying inside of Databricks. This notebook assumes that you have a file already inside of DBFS that you would like to read from. Moreover, it is performed a pre-processing of data and EDA on the dataframe using Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "PART II - Jupyter Notebook: this second part is based on the extraction from Databricks of the first part, its main focus is on aplying a Sentiment Analysis forecast oat 1 week, 1 month and 3 months going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is written in **Python** so the default cell type is Python. However, you can use different languages by using the `%LANGUAGE` syntax. Python, Scala, SQL, and R are all supported."
